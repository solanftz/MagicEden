Hey all, thanks for checking in. I've built two scripts for pulling your wallet Transaction data from Magic Eden into a CSV file on your desktop. 
One for single wallet, and one for multi-wallet. Super easy to use, instructions below:

Single Wallet
1. magicEdenSingleWallet.py
- Simply run the code, and you will be prompted for a wallet address. 
- Enter wallet address, and a CSV file called "data.csv" will contain your transactions.

2. magicEdenMultiWallet.py
- Create a text file called "wallets.txt", with each wallet address on a new line in the file.
- Place that file in the same folder as the script, and run the code!
- That's it! CSV file will be downloaded called "data.csv", containing your transactions.
